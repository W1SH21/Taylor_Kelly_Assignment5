make instructions:
     "make": compiles both drivers (main and selectSize)
     "make clean": removes compiled artifacts (executables and object files)

drivers:
    main:
	reads array data from a file specified in argc
	(behavior specified in the first part of the project instructions)

    selectSize:
	prompts user for an array size and weather to display the sorted arrays, and the sorting algorithm to be used
	populates array with pseudorandom values and runs the chosen sort
	calculates comparisons made over 10 different random arrays, computes average, and displays all data
	if the user chose to display the sorted arrays, comparison data is displayed last
